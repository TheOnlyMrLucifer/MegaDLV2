  <summary><b>Deploying to Heroku</b></summary>

<br>

- Choose Europe as server location when deploying. (Beacuse downloadings will be a little fast!).

  <summary><b>Deploying on a VPS</b></summary>

<br>

**Make a vps (Recommended - Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS) x64 vps from a location/region near New Zealand) and log in to it.**

```sh  
tmux
```
**Now there are two methods to go further!**
- Method 1
  
  - Fork my repo. In the repo go inside to the `sample_config.py` and copy all the code in it. In your forked repo, create a file named `config.py` and paste the whole code in it. 
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Inside your `config.py` file you will see the examples of how to edit the fields.)
  - Then execute the below commands. üëá

```sh  
git clone You_forked_repo_url
```
```sh  
apt install python3-pip
```
```sh  
apt install ffmpeg
```
```sh  
cd mega-link-downloader-bot
```
```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
python3 bot.py

```sh  
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
```sh  
cp sample_config.py config.py
```
```sh  
nano config.py
```
  - Now you will be inside the `config.py` file.
  - Then edit the values in it with your values! (Inside your `config.py` file you will see the examples of how to edit the fields.)
  - (For pasting letters, copy any value you want and take the curser to the place you want by arrow keys and right click the mouse! üòÖ)
  - After editing all with appropriate values as mentioned in the config file press Ctrl + X from your keyboard.
  - Then press y in your keyboard.
